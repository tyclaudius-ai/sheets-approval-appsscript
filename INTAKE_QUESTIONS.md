# Client Intake — Sheets Approvals

Copy/paste answers:

1) What is the sheet used for? (purchase requests, content approvals, onboarding, etc.)
2) Who are the approvers? (emails / roles)
3) What are the statuses you want? (PENDING/APPROVED/REJECTED etc.)
4) Which columns should trigger re-approval when edited?
5) Any rules? (e.g., require 2 approvals if $ > 5,000; route by department)
6) Do you want row locking/protection after approval?
7) Notifications needed? (email/slack) If yes, who gets what and when?
8) Do you need a form intake (Google Form) to create new requests?
9) Any compliance needs? (audit retention, named approvers, timestamps)
10) Timeline: when do you want it live?

If you can’t share the real sheet, share a sanitized copy with the same column structure.
