# Outreach Templates — Google Sheets Approval + Audit Trail (Microproduct)

Goal: book quick, low-friction paid setups for teams that already run approvals in Google Sheets (ops, finance, procurement, lab inventory, travel, reimbursements).

## Positioning (one-liner)
Turn any Google Sheet into an **approve/reject workflow** with an **append-only audit log** (who/when/what changed) — no new tool to learn.

## Template 1 — Upwork Proposal (short)
Hi <Name> — I can add an **Approve/Reject** workflow directly inside your existing Google Sheet.

Deliverables:
- Custom menu buttons: **Approve / Reject**
- **Append-only audit log** (timestamp, approver, row id, decision, optional notes)
- Optional: simple row-lock warning + tamper-evident hash snapshot
- 10–15 min handoff + short Loom walkthrough

If you share a screenshot of the sheet + what counts as “approved”, I can implement in 24h.

## Template 2 — Cold DM / Email (very short)
Subject: Add approve/reject + audit log to your Google Sheet

Quick idea: if your team runs approvals in Sheets (expenses, orders, requests), I can add **Approve/Reject buttons** + an **audit log** so you have a clean record of who approved what and when.

If you want, send a screenshot (redact sensitive info) and I’ll tell you exactly how I’d wire it.

## Template 3 — Slightly longer (problem → solution → CTA)
Subject: Make your Sheet approvals auditable (without switching tools)

If you’re using Google Sheets for requests/approvals, the pain is usually:
- unclear who approved
- no decision history
- accidental edits after approval

I ship a small Apps Script add-on for *your* sheet:
- Approve/Reject actions
- append-only audit log
- optional tamper-evident hash snapshot per decision

CTA: Want me to set it up? If you send your current columns + approval rules, I’ll implement and record a 5–10 min walkthrough.

## Qualifying questions (copy/paste)
1) What does “approval” mean (which column(s) should be written)?
2) Who are the approvers (email domain / list)?
3) Should rejected rows be editable afterward?
4) Do you need multiple stages (e.g., manager → finance)?

## Pricing ideas (for quick quoting)
- **$49**: single-sheet, single-stage approve/reject + audit log
- **$99**: + approver allowlist + rejection notes + basic validation
- **$199**: multi-stage + row-lock protection + light customization + Loom + 7-day support
